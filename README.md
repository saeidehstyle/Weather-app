# Weather App

This project is a weather application that allows users to search for current weather and forecasts based on their location or a specified city. The app provides temperature data in both Celsius and Fahrenheit, supports geolocation, and includes a dynamic background that updates based on the weather condition.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the application.
- `styles.css`: Provides styling for the application including animations and responsive design.
- `script.js`: Contains JavaScript code for interacting with the OpenWeatherMap API, handling user inputs, and updating the UI.

## Features

- **Search by Location**: Enter a city name to get current weather and forecasts.
- **Use My Location**: Get weather information based on the user's current geolocation.
- **Temperature Unit Selection**: Switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- **Dynamic Background**: The background image changes based on the current weather condition.
